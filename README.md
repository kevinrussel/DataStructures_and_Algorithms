## Datastructure and Algo
Feb/8/2026

This is a repository that will be me creating the most used algorithms and datastructures.
This is to learn and really have an indepth understanding of the processes, such that when I do leetcode, it won't be me just 
guessing and trying to hack together some algorithms, but rather taking it from my toolkit and using it for the problems.

### Folder split:
This project will be split up into three different subfolders.

- Tests:
    
    - This folder will hold the test cases that I will make.
- Datastructure:

    - This will hold the datastructures I want to make.

- Algo's

    - This will hold the algo's, which will include sorting and finding.

Okay with that being said, let's get this bread.
